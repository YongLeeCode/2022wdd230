            <p>Hick's  Law states that the more options someone is presented with, the longer it will take to make a decision. We can see this in action on two different
                websites that are on opposite ends of this spectrum. The homepage of Google.com is very simple. When you visit the site, all you see is the searchbar in the middle.
            Over the years they have added more options here and there, but the main focus, that searchbar, remains the center of attention.</p>
            <p>In constrast to this, take Netflix.com. They have a huge assortment of movies and TV shows to choose from. Despite this, many people spend
                almost as much time browsing the selections to decide what to watch as they do actually consuming the media!</p>

            <p>This is one of huge website. On their website, you can see the advertisement about some good deals.
                You can see in this image that the runner is offset to the right, dividing the photo into a 2/3rds section and a 1/3 section.</p>
            <p>The Rule of Thirds is important because this offset in the photo attracts the human eye. It creates interest and draws your attention.</p>

            <p>Contrast is another important feature of design. It increases how interesting your page is and can help to direct the reader's attention where you want it to go.</p>
            <p>Here, on Lego's website, we see that the first decision you make when you visit the site is whether you want to shop, or play games. The selection on the left is for parents, and the one on the right is for children.
                We can see the contrast between these two immediately. The selection for the children has bright colors and doodles, while the one for the parents is more reserved. It has darker colors, smaller font, and even the Lego characters shown look to be adults.
